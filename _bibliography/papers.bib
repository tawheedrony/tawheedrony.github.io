  title={Automated Level Crossing System - A Computer Vision Based Approach with Raspberry Pi Microcontroller},
  author={Murshed, R. U. and Druba, S. K. and Bhuian, T. I. and Rumi, A.},
  abstract = {In a rapidly flourishing country like Bangladesh, accidents in unmanned level crossings
  are increasing daily. This study presents a deep learning-based approach for automating level 
  crossing junctions, ensuring maximum safety. Here, we develop a fully automated technique 
  using computer vision on a microcontroller to reduce and eliminate level-crossing deaths and 
  accidents. A Raspberry Pi microcontroller detects impending trains using computer vision on 
  live video, and the intersection is closed until the incoming train passes unimpeded. Live 
  video activity recognition and object detection algorithms scan the junction 24/7. Self-regulating 
  microcontrollers control the entire process. When persistent unauthorized activity is identified, 
  authorities, such as the police and fire brigade, are notified via automated messages and 
  notifications. The microcontroller evaluates live rail-track data and arrival and departure times 
  to anticipate ETAs, train position, velocity, and track problems to avoid head-on collisions. This 
  proposed scheme reduces level crossing accidents and fatalities at a lower cost than current market 
  solutions.},
