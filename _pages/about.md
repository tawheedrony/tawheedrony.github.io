Hi, I am Tawheed! I am a CS PhD student at <a href='https://www.binghamton.edu/'>SUNY Binghamton</a>, advised by <a href = 'http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~kang?_gl=1*1xn9zka*_gcl_au*OTE1NjU3NTAyLjE3NzAxMjY4NDg.*_ga*MTMzMjAyMTk2NS4xNzcwMTI2ODQ4*_ga_JXLF9XGJ88*czE3NzA0MzMzMTMkbzUkZzAkdDE3NzA0MzMzMTMkajYwJGwwJGgw'>Dr. Kyoung Don Kang</a>

My research focuses on application of multimodal models for 2D/3D visual perception tasks and scene understanding. I am also motivated on studies related to perception with emerging sensing modalities such as event camera, mmWave radar etc. My interests is in joint optimization of sensors, compute and models.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Telnyx](https://telnyx.com) and as a Data Engineer at [Moonfrog Labs](https://moonfroglabs.com). I completed my B.Sc. in Electrical & Electronic Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology [(BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/#/).
