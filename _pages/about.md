Graduate Research Assistant at [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu/), School of Computing.

Currently, I am working on test-time adaptation of Vision Language Models (VLM) via Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and developing robust perception frameworks for real-time autonomous systems. 

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Telnyx](https://telnyx.com) and as a Data Engineer at [Moonfrog Labs](https://moonfroglabs.com). I completed my B.Sc. in Electrical & Electronic Engineering from [Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/#/).

My research interests include:

* Computer Vision & Perception
* Vision Language Models
* Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Systems
* Real-Time Intelligent Sensing
