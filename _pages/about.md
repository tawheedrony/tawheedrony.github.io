A data science professional, currently working as an analyst for game & product at [Moonfrog](https://moonfroglabs.com). I work and communicate with cross-functional team of product managers, producers, designers, artists and QA engineers on day-to-day operations. I have over two years of experience implementing data-driven solutions with analytics, A/B Testing, natural language processing, monetization and user acquisition campaigns etc. Prior to joining here, I completed by undergraduate studies (B.Sc) in Electrical & Electronic Engineering from Bangladesh University of Science & Technology ([BUET](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/#/)). During my undergraduate thesis, I created a model architecture for non-intrusive load monitoring of residential buildings using deep recurrent neural networks, that's what sparked the interest of data science in me. 

I am eager to pursue graduate studies (M.S & Ph.D) in Computer Science. My research goal is to develop state of the art machine learning methods to address solutions for biomedical and energy industry. If you are taking new students, I would like to know about research opportunities to work with you.
